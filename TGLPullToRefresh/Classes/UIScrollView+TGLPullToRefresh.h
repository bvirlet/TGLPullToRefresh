/**
 TGLPullToRefresh is a very easy to use "pull to refresh" component.

 The goal is to make it super easy to customize. Unlike UIRefreshControl, it doesn't force
 you to use a specific activity indicator. With TGLPullToRefresh, you can use the view you
 like as long as it implements a minimalistic protocol.
 */

/**
 Your loading indicator view must implement this protocol.
 */

// Progress > 1: if user releases, refresh is triggered
